# Movie Freaks!
This project is a basic movie showcase website built using ASP.NET MVC. The website allows users to browse and manage information about movies, actors, and producers. It features separate pages for displaying details of movies, actors, and producers, along with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for each entity.

Key Features:

Movies Page: Displays a list of movies with details such as title, release date, and description. Users can add, edit, or delete movies.

Actors Page: Shows a list of actors with their names, biographies, and other relevant information. Actors can be added, updated, or removed.

Producers Page: Lists producers with their details, including their names and contributions. Producers can also be managed through CRUD operations.

User-Friendly Interface: The website provides an intuitive interface for easy navigation and management of data.

This project demonstrates the use of ASP.NET MVC for building a dynamic web application with database interaction, model-view-controller architecture, and basic CRUD operations. It serves as a foundation for further enhancements, such as user authentication, advanced search, or integration with external APIs.
